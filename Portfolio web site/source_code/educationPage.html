            <h2>The first of September 2011</h2>
            <p>I went to the school â„–1329 in Moscow. This school specialized in linguistics. 
                That is why I had English lessons at least three times a week in the primary school. I did not have any difficulties with English as I attended English courses with native speakers for 2 years before school.</p>

            <p> I had excellent marks in all subjects during this period. In the fifth class I took a lot of new subjects such as Physics, Biology, Computer Science, Algebra and Geometry. At this moment I understood that I like Algebra, Geometry, Physics and Computer Science way more than any other subjects.</p>

              <p>As my school specialized in linguistics, in the 7th class 
                I decided to enroll in the highly ranked lyceum 1535 in Moscow, 
                that decision was a turning point in my life. I started studying thoroughly and meticulously that year,
                 as I was determined to get into a better school. There were three exams that I needed to pass: 
                 the maths exam, the Russian language exam, and the English language exam. I got enough points to be enrolled in the lyceum. I was delighted with the news, 
                 because I understood that this had a great influence on my future life.</p>

              <h2>8th class</h2>
              <p>As I started going to the new school I understood that the learning requirements were much higher than in my previous school.
                   At first, it was tough for me, but later I got the hang of it. Thanks to lyceum I began to like 
                   studying because new material was given in a very thought-provoking way. More and more I started 
                   to realize that my favorite subjects are Physics, Maths and Computer Science.</p>

              <h2>9th class</h2>
              <p>The second year in the Lyceum was not as hard as the first one. At the end of the ninth class, 
                  I had to choose a specialization for the last two years of school, so I started to think about
                   what I would like to do in the future. As I was really interested in Computer Science I decided 
                   to enroll in the IT class. I had to pass Maths and Computer Science exams to be accepted. It was practicing
                    a lot and it was not hard for me. In the middle of April, I knew that I was enrolled, that is why I decided 
                    to take additional courses. I wanted to try my hand at being a developer, I purchased an online course, but honestly I did 
                    not enjoy the process of making games, so I got a refund and learned how to make websites. (You can find certificates for all courses down below)</p>

              <p>The new year I started with great interest, as I really wanted to study computer science at a higher level and maths too. 
                Within a week I soon came to find that I had a much higher level of maths and computer science than in the previous years, the tasks were complex and these classes really boosted my knowledge to a new level.
                  Also, I had an amazing subject called programming there we studied different programming languages. That year I decided to 
                  make a project dedicated to ecology. I made an app that will make a difference in nowadays situation. This app is called EcoStep 
                  and it helps people to calculate their carbon footprint and then the app gives personal tips on how to reduce that footprint. To make this app 
                  I studied IOS development for two months. <a href = "projectsPage.html">Click here to read more about EcoStep.</a> What is more, in the tenth I decided to make up my mind and choose where I
                would like to study in the future. As a result, now I would like to get a degree in the Netherlands in the Artificial Intelligence sphere. </p>
